To anyone reading this, you should know I've been using docker for slightly
more than one day, so do not take any of this as anything but the scribblings of
an ignorant amateur.

Installed docker engine according to these instructions:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

on advice from dfirebaugh.  He says the distro apt packages tend to
be old enough to cause problems.

Note about "docker" unix group-id:

Generally, you want your real group id to be "docker" when
executing the "docker" command.  So you should open a new
terminal for docker operations, and do "newgrp docker" to
change your real group ID to docker.

Otherwise you will have sudo and run docker as root, which is not
ideal.  Note, if you go tromping around touching/creating lots of
files, all those files will get tagged with group of "docker",
which you may not want, so exercise discipline in what you do
after the "newgrp".  

Note also that newgrp starts a new shell, so you can "exit" to get
back to your regular group.  If you want to do "newgrp" inside of a
shellscript, do this:

	newgrp docker<<EOF
	put docker commands here
	EOF

Various docker commands:

docker pull ubuntu[:tag] 
	download ubuntu docker image from https://hub.docker.com/search
	optionally a tagged version.

docker image ls
docker image list
	show docker images you have
	the <none> <none> images that may show up are "layers"
	sometimes there can be dangling "<none> <none>" images that take up space,
	which you can find by:

		docker images -f "dangling=true" -q

	and remove by:

		docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)


docker run -d -t --name hostname ubuntu 
		create a new docker instance? named "hostname" using image "ubuntu"
		-d means "detached"
		-t means allocate a pseudo-TTY

		-p port:port maps host port to container port, e.g. "-p 80:80" for http, etc.

docker ps
	show docker containers (by default, only running containers)
	-a - show all containers

docker exec -it hostname bash
	execute bash shell in hostname
	-i = interactive
	-t = tty

docker stop containername
	stop container (does not delete container)

docker start containername
	restarts stopped container

docker stats
	shows stats of all containers

docker rmi imagename
	removes a docker image
